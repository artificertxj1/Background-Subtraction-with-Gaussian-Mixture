# Background-Subtraction-with-Gaussian-Mixture

A python code of background subtraction using GMM which is described in "Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking" by C. Stauffer and W.E.L. Grimson. 
The code is really slow. For a real world application, one should use BackgroundSubtractor class (MOG or MOG2 function) which is a part of OpenCV library.
For useful references of the method, one can check at:
